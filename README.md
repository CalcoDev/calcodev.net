After 3 years of web development, finally a personal website.

## Description

This is a personal website, built with SvelteKit. It will be the main hub for my projects, and a place to showcase my skills, a place to try out new things, and a place to learn. That being said however, here are a few disclaimers:

1. This is a work in progress, and will be for a while.
2. I am not a designer. I am a mainly a programmer. The designs will chance hopefully change a lot over time, as I learn more about design.
